****Initial Folder and File Setup****
- Created folder named thesquad-ow
- Added a file called main.py
- Added a requirements file

****Created Virtual Environment****
- (While in the primary directory) - "python -m venv [pref_name]"
    - I used "python -m venv .venv"
- To activate environment, I used:
    - .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
- Verify interpreter by using "python --version" or:
    - "ctrl + shift + p"
    - Type in "python"
    - Select Python interpreter and choose the .venv


****Installed Dependencies****
- PILLOW
    - Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that adds image processing 
    capabilities to your Python interpreter. It allows you to open, manipulate, 
    and save many different image file formats.
    - Key Features:
        - Image Processing: Crop, resize, rotate, and apply filters to images.
        - File Formats: Support for many image file formats like PNG, JPEG, BMP,

- PYTESSERACT
    - pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. Tesseract 
    is an *optical character recognition* (OCR) tool for recognizing text in images. 
    - Key Features: 
        - OCR: Extract text from images, including support for multiple languages.
        - Integration: Easy integration with Pillow and OpenCV for pre-processing 
          images before OCR.
        - Extensibility: Ability to customize OCR behavior using Tesseract's configuration 
          options.
    - COMMAND:
        - "pip install pytesseract"
